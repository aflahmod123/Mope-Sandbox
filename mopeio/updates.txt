-increased respawn xp amount. (now keep ~20% of your xp!)
-NEW (Sneak peek of) large lakes in the game, check them out (watch out for crocs!)
-Animals have varying speeds of swimming (most at 0.7 times walking speed), somewhat similar to the mud animals (pig, croc, hippo).
-Bears move quickly in water, dragons fly over it
-Water level slowly re-fills in lakes for all animals.
-1/5 of Mushrooms will spawn in lakes, to attract prey to lakes.
(Lakes are getting several extra updates TOMORROW, including: animals going underwater, new lake animal,
 new food exclusive to lakes to attract players into it!)
-Game area 5% larger, mushrooms are 30% more common now.


Update (Oct 20) New animal tweaks, bug fixes
-Tweaked deer, bear, and other animals to balance them out.
-Deer is slower, water drains faster.
-Bear is slightly smaller, moves quicker over hills
-Animals dying of thirst/ disconnecting now drop part of their xp in mushrooms/new dark food (500xp per eat!).
-Water shoots farther
-Entering hiding holes animation bug fixed
-Preparing for lakes update!

Update (Oct 19) New animals, biting improvements
-Easier to bite animal tails, 2X more damage from tail bites, large predators turn much slower (easier to bite!)
-Hippos made more powerful, faster, smaller
-Small animals can now hide in the BIG hiding holes as well.
-NEW animal: deer [after fox]: water drains fast, moves fast, eats only mushrooms! Run from lions and above.
-NEW animal: bear [after cheetah](grr), it's a slow hunter, can slowly climb over green hills!

Update (Oct 18-) The tails update

-new grey 'rock' hills (no animals can move through these)
-lowered bites-to-kill for all animals, health comes back 3x slower
-Lowered XP needed for higher animals :)
-NEW tails update: small animals can finally fight back (this was highly requested), just bite the (green-outlined) tail of a predator!
-Tweaked animal biting- you must face towards an animal in order to bite it (logical)
-NEW (big) hiding caves, for predators! (There are very few of these in the game, so they won't take the food chain off balance)
-Tweaked all animal speeds according to feedback (not by much)
